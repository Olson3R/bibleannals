# Goals
- Create a website to show a timeline of biblical people, events, and regions
- Information needs to be presented in a simple manner
- Accuracy is very important

# Bash commands
- npm run build: Build the project

# Code style
- Use ES modules (import/export) syntax, not CommonJS (require)
- Destructure imports when possible (eg. import { foo } from 'bar')
- Keep files focused
  - Create files as needed to maintain focus, purpose, and smaller size
- The website needs to be responsive and accessible

# Workflow
- Be sure to make sure it builds when youâ€™re done making a series of code changes
- Prefer running single tests, and not the whole test suite, for performance
